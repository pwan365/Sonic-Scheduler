## What's been done

Optimal solution classes: node, (tasks), processes

main focus: cost function

I/O has been done, a tree model is constructed automatically

## Git setup

John push up tasks

## Break down tasks

Creating UML class diagrams first

## Valid solution (Greedy Algorithm, choose the shortest possible time at each level)

1. I/O (A graphStream object will be return)
2. Topological sort the graph (Might be a default library call to sort it automatically. However need to look into more since there might be multiple orders)
3. A way to queue them in a data structure, e.g. queue
4. Array list of processors
5. while queue â‰  empty, we pop the first element then find the most efficient scheduling (earliest scheduling time) among all processors. 
6. Write to output
