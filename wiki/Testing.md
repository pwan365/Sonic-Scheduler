# Optimal Testing

## Speed Tester

Speed tester class will test whether the optimal scheduling time is optimal.
we manually wrote the test cases and used it as a guideline for debugging.

Graphs were drawn from those provided, as well as online resources.

## Automatic Speed Tester
This test file has a parameterized test. It will read from the graph folder and automatically read the expected time
and other required information from the custom graphs. Although it doesn't indicate which file has been looked at, it
is great for debugging.
